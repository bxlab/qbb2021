    "\n",
    "- Write a shell script that runs a command or series of commands for a fixed set of files.\n",
    "- Run a shell script from the command line.\n",
    "- Write a shell script that operates on a set of files defined by the user on the command line.\n",

    "We are finally ready to see what makes the shell such a powerful programming environment. We are going to take the commands we repeat frequently and save them in files so that we can re-run all those operations again later by typing a single command. For historical reasons, a bunch of commands saved in a file is usually called a `shell script`, but make no mistake: these are actually small programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only will writing shell scripts make your work faster– you won’t have to retype the same commands over and over again– it will also make it more accurate (fewer chances for typos) and more reproducible. If you come back to your work later (or if someone else finds your work and wants to build on it) you will be able to reproduce the same results simply by running your script, rather than having to remember or retype a long list of commands.\n",

    "\n",
    "We usually call programs like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer “text editors”, but we need to be a bit more careful when it comes to programming. By default, Microsoft Word uses `.docx` files to store not only text, but also formatting information about fonts, headings, and so on. This extra information isn’t stored as characters and doesn’t mean anything to tools like `head`: they expect input files to contain nothing but the letters, digits, and punctuation on a standard computer keyboard. When editing programs, therefore, you must either use a plain text editor, or be careful to save files as plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we want to select lines from an arbitrary file?

If we want to be able to get a sorted list of other kinds of files, we need a way to get all those names into the script.

The disadvantage is that it always selects just those files — she can’t run it on all files (including the ‘Z’ files), or on the ‘G’ or ‘H’ files her colleagues in Antarctica are producing, without editing the script. If she wanted to be more adventurous, she could modify her script to check for command-line arguments, and use `NENE*[AB].txt` if none were provided. Of course, this introduces another tradeoff between flexibility and complexity.\n",
