    "- How can I perform the same actions on many different files?\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a loop that applies one or more commands separately to each file in a set of files.\n",
    "- Trace the values taken on by a loop variable during execution of the loop.\n",
    "- Explain the difference between a variable’s name and its value.\n",
    "- Explain why spaces and some punctuation characters shouldn’t be used in file names.\n",
    "- Demonstrate how to see what commands have recently been executed.\n",
    "- Re-run recently executed commands without retyping them.\n",

    "**Loops** are a programming construct which allow us to repeat a command or set of commands for each item in a list. As such they are key to productivity improvements through automation. Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the amount of typing required (and hence reduces the number of typing mistakes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have several hundred genome data files named `basilisk.dat`, `minotaur.dat`, and `unicorn.dat`. For this example, we’ll use the `creatures` directory which only has three example files, but the principles can be applied to many many more files at once.\n",

    "We would like to print out the classification for each species, which is given on the second line of each file. For each file, we would need to execute the command `head -n 2` and pipe this to `tail -n 1`. We’ll use a loop to solve this problem, but first let’s look at the general form of a loop:\n",

    "done\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",

    "and we can apply this to our example like this:\n",

    "### Follow the Prompt\n",
    "The shell prompt changes from `$` to `>` and back again as we were typing in our loop. The second prompt, `>`, is different to remind us that we haven’t finished typing a complete command yet. A semicolon, `;`, can be used to separate two commands written on a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the shell sees the keyword `for`, it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each item in a list. Each time the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in sequence to the **variable**, and the commands inside the loop are executed, before moving on to the next item in the list. Inside the loop, we call for the variable’s value by putting `$` in front of it. The $ tells the shell interpreter to treat the variable as a variable name and substitute its value in its place, rather than treat it as text or an external command.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the list is three filenames: `basilisk.dat`, `minotaur.dat`, and `unicorn.dat`. Each time the loop iterates, it will assign a file name to the variable `filename` and run the `head` command. The first time through the loop, `$filename` is `basilisk.dat`. The interpreter runs the command `head` on `basilisk.dat` and pipes the first two lines to the `tail` command, which then prints the second line of `basilisk.dat`. For the second iteration, `$filename` becomes `minotaur.dat`. This time, the shell runs `head` on `minotaur.dat` and pipes the first two lines to the `tail` command, which then prints the second line of `minotaur.dat`. For the third iteration, `$filename` becomes `unicorn.dat`, so the shell runs the `head` command on that file, and `tail` on the output of that. Since the list was only three items, the shell exits the `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Same Symbols, Different Meanings\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see `>` being used as a shell prompt, whereas `>` is also used to redirect output. Similarly, `$` is used as a shell prompt, but, as we saw earlier, it is also used to ask the shell to get the value of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the shell prints `>` or `$` then it expects you to type something, and the symbol is a prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you type `>` or `$` yourself, it is an instruction from you that the shell should redirect output or get the value of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using variables it is also possible to put the names into curly braces to clearly delimit the variable name: `$filename` is equivalent to `${filename}`, but is different from `${file}name`. You may find this notation in other people’s programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have called the variable in this loop `filename` in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers. The shell itself doesn’t care what the variable is called; if we wrote this loop as:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Bash**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ for x in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat\n",
    "> do\n",
    ">     head -n 2 $x | tail -n 1\n",
    "> done\n",

    "---\n",

    "it would work exactly the same way. Don’t do this. Programs are only useful if people can understand them, so meaningless names (like x) or misleading names (like temperature) increase the odds that the program won’t do what its readers think it does.\n",
