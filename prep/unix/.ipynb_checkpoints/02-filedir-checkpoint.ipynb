    "- Explain the similarities and differences between a file and a directory.\n",

[Arguments](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/reference.html#argument) tell the command what to operate on (e.g. files and directories).

First, she creates a directory called `north-pacific-gyre` (to remind herself where the data came from). Inside that, she creates a directory called `2012-07-03`, which is the date she started processing the samples. She used to use names like `conference-paper` and `revised-results`, but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years. (The final straw was when she found herself creating a directory called `revised-revised-results-3`.)\n",

If she used month names, December would come before July; if she didn’t use leading zeroes, November (‘11’) would come before July (‘7’). Similarly, putting the year first means that June 2012 will come before June 2013.\n",

    "Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab’s convention with a unique ten-character ID, such as ‘NENE01729A’. This ID is what she used in her collection log to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample, so she decides to use it as part of each data file’s name. Since the assay machine’s output is plain text, she will call her files `NENE01729A.txt`,` NENE01812A.txt`, and so on. All 1520 files will go into the same directory.\n",
