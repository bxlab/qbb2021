As in real carpentry --- the kind done with lumber --- the time saved by measuring carefully before cutting a piece of wood is much greater than the time that measuring takes.\n\n\n## Assertions\n\n\nThe first step toward getting the right answers from our programs is to assume that mistakes *will* happen and to guard against them. This is called <span style=\"color:red\" title=\"The practice of writing programs that check their own operation to catch errors as early as possible.\">defensive programming</span>, and the most common way to do it is to add <span style=\"color:red\" title=\"An expression which is supposed to be true at a particular point in a program. Programmers typically put assertions in their code to check for errors; if the assertion fails (i.e., if the expression evaluates as false), the program halts and produces an error message. See also: invariant, precondition, postcondition.\">assertions</span> to our code so that it checks itself as it runs. An assertion is simply a statement that something must be true at a certain point in a program. When Python sees one, it evaluates the assertion's condition. If it's true, Python does nothing, but if it's false, Python halts the program immediately and prints the error message if one is provided. For example, this piece of code halts as soon as the loop encounters a value that isn't positive:\n\n\n",

In a Jupyter notebook, you can display line numbers by typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> followed by <kbd>L</kbd>. If we had left out the assertion at the end of the function, we would have created and returned something that had the right shape as a valid answer, but wasn't. Detecting and debugging that would almost certainly have taken more time in the long run than writing the assertion.\n\n\nBut assertions aren't just about catching errors: they also help people understand programs. Each assertion gives the person reading the program a chance to check (consciously or otherwise) that their understanding matches what the code is doing.\n\n\nMost good programmers follow two rules when adding assertions to their code. The first is, *fail early, fail often*. The greater the distance between when and where an error occurs and when it's noticed, the harder the error will be to debug, so good code catches mistakes as early as possible.\n\n\nThe second rule is, *turn bugs into assertions or tests*. Whenever you fix a bug, write an assertion that catches the mistake should you make it again. If you made a mistake in a piece of code, the odds are good that you have made other mistakes nearby, or will make the same mistake (or a related one) the next time you change it. Writing assertions to check that you haven't <span style=\"color:red\" title=\"To re-introduce a bug that was once fixed.\">regressed</span> (i.e., haven't re-introduced an old problem) can save a lot of time in the long run, and helps to warn people who are reading the code (including your future self) that this bit is tricky.\n\n\n## Test-Driven Development\n\n\nAn assertion checks that something is true at a particular point in the program. The next step is to check the overall behavior of a piece of code, i.e., to make sure that it produces the right output when it's given a particular input. For example, suppose we need to find where two or more time series overlap. The range of each time series is represented as a pair of numbers, which are the time the interval started and ended. The output is the largest range that they all include:\n\n\n> <img src=fig/python-overlapping-ranges.svg>Overlapping Ranges\n\n\nMost novice programmers would solve this problem like this:\n\n\n1.  Write a function `range_overlap`.\n\n2.  Call it interactively on two or three different inputs.\n\n3.  If it produces the wrong answer, fix the function and re-run that test.\n\nThis clearly works --- after all, thousands of scientists are doing it right now --- but there's a better way:\n\n\n1.  Write a short function for each test.\n\n2.  Write a `range_overlap` function that should pass those tests.\n\n3.  If `range_overlap` produces any wrong answers, fix it and re-run the test functions.\n\nWriting the tests *before* writing the function they exercise is called <span style=\"color:red\" title=\"\">test-driven development</span> (TDD). Its advocates believe it produces better code faster because:\n\n\n1.  If people write tests after writing the thing to be tested, they are subject to confirmation bias, i.e., they subconsciously write tests to show that their code is correct, rather than to find errors.\n\n2.  Writing tests helps programmers figure out what the function is actually supposed to do.\n\nHere are three test functions for `range_overlap`:\n\n\n",

Any actual implementation of the function will do one of these things; writing the tests first helps us figure out which is best *before* we're emotionally invested in whatever we happened to write before we realized there was an issue.\n\n\nAnd what about this case?\n\n\n---\n\n\n<span style=\"color:blue\">In [1]:</span>\n```python\nassert range_overlap([ (0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 2.0) ]) == ???\n```\n---\n\n\n\n\nDo two segments that touch at their endpoints overlap or not?
