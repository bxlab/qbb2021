Some people prefer this as it is quicker to type and results in shorter lines of code - especially for libraries with long names! You will frequently see Python code online using a NumPy function with `np`, and it's because they've used this shortcut. It makes no difference which approach you choose to take, but you must be consistent as if you use `import numpy as np` then `numpy.loadtxt(...)` will not work, and you must use `np.loadtxt(...)` instead.
