Students will use [GitHub](http://github.com/) to turn in assignments and TAs/instructors will directly provide feedback through Github

1. Please [sign up for a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) if you don’t already have one.
2. After you’ve signed up for an account and signed in, please “watch” the [qbb2021 repository](https://github.com/bxlab/qbb2021/blob/main/README.md).  
    * Clicking the qbb2021 link should bring you to that repository. There, the watch button looks like an eye and will be in the second line of icons in the upper right hand corner of the page. It should also be labelled “Watch” right next to the eye.
3. Then, create a repository called qbb2021-answers.
    * Use the “+” button in the first line of icons in the upper right hand corner of the page.
    * Select “New Repository”
    * Give it the name of “qbb2021-answers” in the “Repository name” blank. 
    * Check “Add a README file”
    * Click the green button “Create repository”
4. Finally, for the qbb2021-answers repository, please add the TAs and the instructors as collaborators. This will allow us to "push" feedback.
    * Our GitHub usernames:
      * kweav
      * stephaniemyan
      * dtaylo95
      * andrew-bortvin
      * rmccoy7541
      * msauria
      * cutsort
   * For each username listed above, please follow these steps
      * From your qbb2021-answers repository, select the “Settings” tab which has a gear icon and is at the end of the line of tabs at the top of the screen.
      * Then, from the list on the left of the page, click “Manage access”. It should be the second in the list.
      * Click the green button “Invite a collaborator” 
      * Search the GitHub username, click it in the dropdown menu, and use the green add button to add the collaborator! :)
